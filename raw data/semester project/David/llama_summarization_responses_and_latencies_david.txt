{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Here is a summary of the passage in under 2,000 characters:\n\nResearchers found that lithium levels in the brain decrease with age and are even lower in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Depleting lithium from the diet of mice led to increased amyloid-Î² deposition, inflammation, and cognitive decline. The study suggests that lithium deficiency may contribute to AD pathogenesis and that replacing lithium with an amyloid-evading salt may be a potential treatment approach."}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Here is a summary of the passage in under 2,000 characters:\n\nAlbert Einstein's theory of relativity consists of special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915). Special relativity applies to situations without gravity, while general relativity explains gravity and its connection to the forces of nature. The theory revolutionized physics and astronomy, introducing concepts like spacetime, time dilation, and length contraction. It also led to predictions of phenomena like neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves."}
