{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "Sure, here is a summary of the passage in less than 2,000 characters:\n\nThe Odyssey is an epic poem by Homer that tells the story of Odysseus, a cunning Greek warrior. The earliest molecular changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are poorly understood. Endogenous lithium (Li) is dynamically regulated in the brain and contributes to cognitive preservation during ageing. Li was significantly reduced in the brain in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Li deficiency increased amyloid-Î² deposition, phospho-tau accumulation, microglial activation, synapse loss, and cognitive decline. Single-nucleus RNA-seq showed that Li deficiency gives rise to transcriptome changes in multiple brain cell types that overlap with transcriptome changes in AD. Li replacement therapy prevented pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD."}

{'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Sure, here is a summary of the passage in less than 2,000 characters:\n\nThe theory of relativity is a physics theory proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905 and 1915. It encompasses two interrelated theories: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity, while general relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to the forces of nature. The theory revolutionized physics and astronomy, introducing concepts such as spacetime, relativity of simultaneity, and length contraction. It also predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars and black holes.'}
